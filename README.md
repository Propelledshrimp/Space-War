Press space to shoot.
You can only take ten hits, or if you make contact with a mob the game will end.
Mobs spawn in waves, at level 5 you will face a boss. 
Buzz Bombers are the first type of mob, and only take one hit to kill. 
Puffers are the second type of enemy that take two hits.
The boss takes a whopping 50 hits to kill! And fires frequently so get ready to dodge some bullets. 
Press R to restart the game after winning or losing.
